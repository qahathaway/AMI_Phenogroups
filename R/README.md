### Performance of Phenogroups in Assessing All-Cause Mortality. (A) Kaplan Meyer curve and stratified risk categories for patients in phenogroups Cluster A, Cluster B, and Cluster C. (B) Time-to-event Concordance Index (C-Index) for groups A) GRACE 2.0 score alone, B) GRACE + Cluster A, C) GRACE + left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), and D) using all three variables through CoxPH regression. (C) Incremental value of ultrasomics features (i.e., Cluster A) in predicting all-cause mortality. GRACE = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events.
